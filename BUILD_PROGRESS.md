# Shopstream Build Progress Tracker

## Project Configuration
- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Prisma ORM
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript (Module Federation for microfrontends)
- **Primary Stack**: AWS-native services + Kafka/Temporal/Cassandra/Redis mainline
- **API Strategy**: REST (external), gRPC (internal), GraphQL (Feed service only)
- **External Services**: 
  - Stripe (payments)
  - Sentry (error tracking)
  - AWS SES (email)
  - AWS AppConfig (feature flags)
- **Repository**: GitHub
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (CI) + ArgoCD (CD for EKS)
- **IaC**: Terraform
- **Tracing**: AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) â†’ X-Ray & CloudWatch

## Core Tech Stack (MAINLINE)

### Event Streaming & CDC
- **MSK (Kafka)**: Single event backbone for all events
  - Topics: product.events, order.lifecycle, payment.events, media.events, analytics.raw, activity.raw
- **Debezium (MSK Connect)**: CDC from Postgres â†’ Kafka
- **Kafka Connect**: OpenSearch Sink (or indexer service) for search projection
- **Flink on EKS**: Stream processing for feed features (reads Kafka â†’ writes Redis/Postgres)
- **Redis Streams**: Ultra-low-latency in-cluster pipelines (thumbnails, notifications, backpressure)
- **EventBridge/Kinesis**: OFF by default (only if AWS/SaaS fanout needed later)

### Data Stores (Right Tool for Right Job)
- **Postgres (RDS)**: 
  - System of record for catalog (products, SKUs, inventory)
  - Orders table (strong consistency needed)
  - Media metadata
  - User profiles (if complex relationships)
  - Any data requiring ACID transactions
  
- **DynamoDB**:
  - Idempotency keys (high-speed key-value)
  - WebSocket connections table
  - Feature flags
  - Session data
  - Shopping carts (user-partitioned)
  - Any single-table design patterns
  
- **Cassandra** (ONLY for write-heavy, append-only):
  - Activity timelines (likes, views, comments) 
  - Event streams that can tolerate eventual consistency
  - Durable feed history (time-series data)
  - NOT for transactional data or strong consistency needs
  
- **Redis**: 
  - Keys + Sorted Sets: Hot objects, feed slices, rate limits, locks
  - Streams: Local ordered work pipelines with consumer groups
  - Cache layer for all data stores
  
- **S3**: Static/media files, audit bucket with Object Lock
- **OpenSearch**: Search projection only (never source of truth)

### Workflows
- **Temporal on EKS** (replaces Step Functions):
  - Orders workflow: reserve stock â†’ create/capture payment â†’ finalize â†’ compensate
  - Media workflow: ingest â†’ transcode â†’ thumbnail â†’ moderate â†’ publish
  - DSAR workflow: orchestrate deletes/exports across all data stores
  - Persistence: Postgres (not Cassandra)

### Security & Infrastructure
- **Security**: WAF, KMS, GuardDuty, CloudTrail, Secrets Manager, Budgets
- **Runtime**: EKS + IRSA, ALB (HTTP/2 for gRPC), CloudFront + Route53 + ACM
- **Auth**: Cognito + DynamoDB (user metadata)

## Overall Progress
**Current Status**: Milestone 1 Complete
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-04
**Active Milestone**: Ready for Milestone 2 - Catalog MVP
**Blockers**: None

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Pyramid
- **Unit Tests**: 80% coverage minimum (Jest, Mocha)
- **Integration Tests**: API & database layer (Supertest, TestContainers)
- **Contract Tests**: API contracts (Pact), gRPC (Buf breaking changes)
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys (Playwright, Cypress)
- **Load Tests**: k6 for API, Locust for scenarios
- **Chaos Tests**: AWS FIS for failure injection

### CI Testing Gates
- Unit tests must pass
- Integration tests with LocalStack
- Contract tests for all APIs
- Security scanning (CodeQL, ECR scanning)
- Lighthouse performance budget checks

### Testing Infrastructure
- LocalStack for AWS service mocking
- TestContainers for database testing
- GitHub Actions for CI pipeline
- Separate test environment in AWS

## Key Decisions Made (UPDATED)

### Core Tech Stack (Per Core Tech One-Pager)
1. **Kafka (MSK) as single event backbone** - All events flow through Kafka, no EventBridge/Kinesis in mainline
2. **Temporal over Step Functions** - Better workflow orchestration for complex sagas
3. **Cassandra for activity timelines** - Write-heavy append-only data and durable feed history
4. **Debezium CDC** - Postgres â†’ Kafka change data capture (not DMS)
5. **Redis Streams for in-cluster pipelines** - Ultra-low-latency ordered work queues
6. **Flink on EKS** - Stream processing for feed features (not Kinesis Analytics)

### Original Decisions (Still Valid)
7. **GraphQL only for Feed Service** - Best demonstrates aggregation benefits
8. **AWS-native where it shines** - Cognito, S3, CloudFront, WAF, KMS, etc.
9. **ADOT over direct X-Ray SDK** - Unified tracing across all services
10. **ArgoCD over CodeDeploy** - Better K8s deployment management
11. **Module Federation for Microfrontends** - True team autonomy
12. **No auto-push to GitHub** - All changes reviewed before commit

## Current Blockers
None

## Next Actions
1. Initialize GitHub repository
2. Set up base AWS infrastructure
3. Create project structure
4. Begin Milestone 0 implementation

## Notes for Handoff
- This document should be updated after each work session
- Mark tasks as completed with âœ…
- Update service status: ðŸ”´ Not Started â†’ ðŸŸ¡ In Progress â†’ ðŸŸ¢ Complete
- Add specific commit hashes when services are deployed
- Document any deviations from original plan
- Include AWS resource ARNs as they're created
