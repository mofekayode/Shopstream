## Testing Strategy

### Testing Pyramid
- **Unit Tests**: 80% coverage minimum (Jest, Mocha)
- **Integration Tests**: API & database layer (Supertest, TestContainers)
- **Contract Tests**: API contracts (Pact), gRPC (Buf breaking changes)
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys (Playwright, Cypress)
- **Load Tests**: k6 for API, Locust for scenarios
- **Chaos Tests**: AWS FIS for failure injection

### CI Testing Gates
- Unit tests must pass
- Integration tests with LocalStack
- Contract tests for all APIs
- Security scanning (CodeQL, ECR scanning)
- Lighthouse performance budget checks

### Testing Infrastructure
- LocalStack for AWS service mocking
- TestContainers for database testing
- GitHub Actions for CI pipeline
- Separate test environment in AWS

## Key Decisions Made

1. **GraphQL only for Feed Service** - Best demonstrates aggregation benefits
2. **AWS-native services preferred** - Reduces operational overhead
3. **Step Functions over Temporal** - Native AWS orchestration
4. **EventBridge + Kinesis over pure Kafka** - Clear separation of concerns
5. **ADOT over direct X-Ray SDK** - Unified tracing across all services
6. **ArgoCD over CodeDeploy** - Better K8s deployment management
7. **Module Federation for Microfrontends** - True team autonomy with independent deployments
8. **No auto-push to GitHub** - All changes reviewed before commit

## Current Blockers
None

## Next Actions
1. Initialize GitHub repository
2. Set up base AWS infrastructure
3. Create project structure
4. Begin Milestone 0 implementation

## Notes for Handoff
- This document should be updated after each work session
- Mark tasks as completed with âœ…
- Update service status: ðŸ”´ Not Started â†’ ðŸŸ¡ In Progress â†’ ðŸŸ¢ Complete
- Add specific commit hashes when services are deployed
- Document any deviations from original plan
- Include AWS resource ARNs as they're created
